At WWDC 2021 Apple released MusicKit for Swift which removes the need to generate your own Apple Music API Developer Token.  See [https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10294/](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10294/) for more details.

Effectively that removes the purpose of this project which was to be able to create the token easily in Swift during CI and remove the need for dependency management to use a Ruby, Python or other JWT library.

As such, this project is archived as of Oct 2021.
